/**
 * Testnet source localization.
 *
 * Contracts hardcode mainnet principals in `use-trait`, `impl-trait` and
 * `contract-call?` references. To publish on testnet those must be rewritten to
 * principals that exist there.
 *
 * Two kinds, and conflating them is how a deploy silently aborts:
 *
 *   OURS               — contracts FlashStack publishes itself. On testnet we
 *                        publish them under the testnet deployer, so every
 *                        reference rewrites to that deployer.
 *   TESTNET_EQUIVALENT — third-party contracts with a VERIFIED byte-identical
 *                        testnet deployment. Remapped to that principal, so the
 *                        staged contract exercises the real dependency rather
 *                        than a mock. Entries require a source-hash comparison.
 *   THIRD_PARTY        — live mainnet protocols (ALEX, Zest, Arkadiko, Velar,
 *                        Bitflow, StackingDAO...) with NO testnet equivalent. A
 *                        contract still referencing one after localization cannot
 *                        be staged, and must say so loudly rather than be
 *                        published against a wrong address.
 *
 * Before this module, scripts/deploy-testnet.mjs knew about exactly two
 * principals and silently left every other one in place — so the current
 * generation (which references three more) would have aborted at publish time
 * with an unresolved contract. See docs/TESTNET_STAGING.md §5.1.
