 * testnet deployer before publishing. It used to know about exactly TWO
 * principals, while the current generation references three more — so a
 * current-gen deploy would have been broadcast with an unresolved contract
 * reference and aborted at publish time, burning the contract name permanently
 * at that address (the same way the live system ended up with -v2/-v3 suffixes).
 *
 * These tests pin which contracts are stageable and which are not, so the answer
