/**
 * Canonical-source drift guard (CONTRACT_INVENTORY.md §5 D6, §7.3).
 *
 * Clarinet keys contracts by name, so `Clarinet.toml` can register only ONE file
 * per contract name. For every funds-bearing contract it registers the localized
 * simnet copy under contracts/test/ — which means `clarinet check` and the whole
 * test suite compile the COPY, and the canonical contracts/*.clar source (the file
 * an auditor reads and a deployment publishes) is compiled by nothing.
 *
 * That is only safe while the copy really is the canonical source with addresses
 * localized and nothing else. Until now nothing enforced that: F-7 is exactly the
 * failure it allows — contracts/test/flashstack-stx-core.clar silently acquired the
 * BC1 two-step admin fix, so the "deployed core" suite spent weeks proving things
 * about a contract that does not exist on mainnet.
 *
 * tests/mainnet-fidelity.test.ts pins the *behavioral shape* of 6 live contracts
 * against what is actually deployed. This test is the complementary half: textual
 * equivalence for all 14 canonical/copy pairs, so a logic change to either side
 * fails CI rather than going unnoticed.
 *
 * THE RULE: the localized copy must equal the canonical source after
 *   (a) stripping `;;` comments and blank lines, and
 *   (b) rewriting every absolute contract reference 'SP…\.name to .name
 * Any other difference — a changed guard, an added function, a different
 * constant — is drift, and fails here.
 *
 * If a difference is legitimate, the contract is not a localized copy: give it its
 * own name as a successor (the pattern flashstack-stx-core-v2 already follows).
