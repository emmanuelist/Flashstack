;; FlashStack Pool v3 -- Generic Multi-Asset Flash-Loan + LP Pool
;;
;; Aave-style generic core: lists any admin-approved SIP-010 token as a
;; flash-loan reserve and LP asset in ONE contract (design decision #3, LOCKED
;; 2026-07-26 in docs/02-technical/MULTI_ASSET_CORE_DESIGN.md -- no separate
;; core/pool; LP liquidity *is* the flash-loan reserve, per asset).
;;
;; Clarity cannot persist a trait reference in state, so every entry point
;; takes the token as a <sip-010-trait> parameter; per-asset state is keyed by
;; (contract-of token) (design doc section 2).
;;
;; Security model (design doc section 7):
;;   - Asset allow-list (add-asset) is LOAD-BEARING FOR SOLVENCY: only admin-
;;     vetted SIP-010 tokens are borrowable/depositable. An unlisted token --
;;     however well- or ill-behaved -- is rejected before any token call is
;;     made. This is what stops a malicious token contract (one that lies
;;     about get-balance/transfer) from ever being reachable through this pool.
;;   - Balance invariant (per asset): flash-loan measures the token balance
;;     before/after the callback and reverts unless it grew by >= fee.
;;   - Receiver whitelist: defense-in-depth during the unaudited beta
;;     (decision #1); not load-bearing for solvency.
;;   - Virtual shares/assets (F-1 fix), per asset, calibrated to each asset's
;;     own decimals (design doc section 13, finding F2).
;;   - Two-step admin transfer (decision #5, BC1 audit finding 2026-08-01):
;;     every currently-deployed governed FlashStack contract uses a one-step,
;;     self-gated admin transfer that permanently bricks governance if given a
;;     bad value, with no recovery. Ported verbatim from the proven fix in
;;     flashstack-sbtc-pool-v3 / flashstack-stx-pool-v3 / flashstack-sbtc-core-v2.
;;   - Per-asset reentrancy lock (design doc section 13, finding F1): blocks
;;     deposit/withdraw/flash-loan from reentering each other for the SAME
;;     asset mid-call. Scoped per-asset (not global) so a receiver's callback
;;     can still legitimately flash-loan a DIFFERENT asset in the same
;;     transaction -- each asset's balance invariant is independently safe
;;     (section 5), and blocking that would regress real multi-asset strategies.
;;   - Withdraw is intentionally NOT gated by asset enabled/paused status: LPs
;;     can always exit their position, matching the invariant already relied
;;     on for v1/v2 pool recovery (withdraw is never pause-gated in any
;;     deployed FlashStack pool). remove-asset soft-disables (enabled: false)
;;     rather than deleting the map entry, specifically so withdraw can keep
;;     reading share-scale/reserve for a delisted asset.
;;
;; NOT YET DEPLOYED. Deploy order: flashstack-v3-receiver-trait FIRST (fresh,
;; under the secure wallet SPR9PQ...), then this contract.
;;
;; Clarity version: 6 (migrated 2026-09-09). `as-contract` was removed in
;; Clarity 4 in favor of `as-contract?` (explicit outflow allowances) and the
;; `current-contract` keyword (for the common "get my own principal" case
;; that carries no privilege at all). Every prior `as-contract` use here was
;; a plain identity read except the two real fund outflows (withdraw's and
;; flash-loan's transfer-out), which now carry an explicit
;; `(with-ft (contract-of token) "*" amount)` allowance -- scoped to the one
;; listed token contract and the exact amount being sent, with "*" for the
;; token-name because this pool is generic across SIP-010 assets and can't
;; know each one's internal `define-fungible-token` name at compile time.
;; Deliberately not `with-all-assets-unsafe`: that grants unrestricted access
;; to every asset the contract holds, which is unnecessary here and exactly
;; the kind of over-broad allowance the SIP itself warns against when a
;; narrower one is available.
